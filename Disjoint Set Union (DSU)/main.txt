DSU ---> Disjoint Set Union

The intersection of all the given sets become null then we called it as Disjoint Set Union

----> Operations in Disjoint Set Union <------

(1) -> Combine Two Given Sets

(2) -> Tell If Two Members Belongs to same set or not. (This is why we also called DSU as Union Find Algorithm)
